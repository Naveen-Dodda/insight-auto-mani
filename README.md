# AutoMani
This project is to help a robot in automated manicure process to track down micro movements of finger. Image segmentation is performed on real time images during the manicure process to find pixels of the finger.  

## Motivation
People can either visit a nail salon, which is time consuming and expensive, or alternatively, paint their nails at home, which is cumbersome and often looks amateur. Yet there is no innovation breakthrough in painting nails. 
Want to change the way people paint their nails and spend their time. 



## Setup
Clone this repo to a machine with an NVidia card (tested on aws p2.xlarge instance).

git clone https://github.com/Naveen-Dodda/insight-ai

## Initial Commit
Lets start with a blank slate: remove `.git` and re initialize the repo
```
cd $repo_name
rm -rf .git   
git init   
git status
```  
You'll see a list of file, these are files that git doesn't recognize. At this point, feel free to change the directory names to match your project. i.e. change the parent directory Insight_Project_Framework and the project directory Insight_Project_Framework:
Now commit these:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin $branch_name
```

## Requisites

- List all packages and software needed to build the environment
- This could include cloud command line tools (i.e. gsutil), package managers (i.e. conda), etc.

#### Dependencies

- [Streamlit](streamlit.io)

#### Installation
To install the package above, pleae run:
```shell
pip install -r requiremnts
```

## Build Environment
- Include instructions of how to launch scripts in the build subfolder
- Build scripts can include shell scripts or python setup.py files
- The purpose of these scripts is to build a standalone environment, for running the code in this repository
- The environment can be for local use, or for use in a cloud environment
- If using for a cloud environment, commands could include CLI tools from a cloud provider (i.e. gsutil from Google Cloud Platform)
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Configs
- We recommond using either .yaml or .txt for your config files, not .json
- **DO NOT STORE CREDENTIALS IN THE CONFIG DIRECTORY!!**
- If credentials are needed, use environment variables or HashiCorp's [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)


## Test
- Include instructions for how to run all tests after the software is installed
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Run Inference
- Include instructions on how to run inference
- i.e. image classification on a single image for a CNN deep learning project
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Build Model
- Include instructions of how to build the model
- This can be done either locally or on the cloud
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Serve Model
- Include instructions of how to set up a REST or RPC endpoint
- This is for running remote inference via a custom model
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```

## Analysis
- Include some form of EDA (exploratory data analysis)
- And/or include benchmarking of the model and results
```
# Example

# Step 1
# Step 2
```
